\problem{17}
\begin{wts}
    A single video source transmits on a 256-kbps link with a throughput of 200 kbps. The data experiences a delay jitter of 2s. What size of delay buffer is required at the destination to eliminate the jitter? What is the utilization over the link?
\end{wts}
\begin{proof}
    Size of delay buffer, at least $200\pow{3}\times2=400\pow{3}$kb. Utilization, defined as the fraction of time the link is used, $U=200/256=0.78125$,
\end{proof}
